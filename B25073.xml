            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <p>WHEREAS it hath been represented to Vs in Our Councel, that the Bakers of this Our City of <hi>Dublin,</hi> (who by vertue of their Charter from Vs, do pretend to exclude all such as are not free of their Fraternity, from exercising the Trade of a Baker within the said City, or the Liberties thereof) have been lately so negligent in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the necessary provision of Bread, that by their contrivance or neglect, Bread grew on a sudden so scarce in the said City, that Our Souldiers and other Our Subjects therein have not been sufficiently supplyed, but at very excessive rates, whereby the said Bakers became justly liable to a forfeiture of their said Charter, if We had thought fit to take advantage thereof. We have therefore thought fit, by the advice of Our said Councel, to publish and make known, that Our Will and Pleasure is, and We do hereby give Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cense to all persons whatsoever, whether Inhabitants of the said City, of the Liberties thereof, or of the several Towns and Counties adjacent, that they and every of them (notwithstanding their being not free of the said Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or of the Corporation of Bakers) shall and may make such quantities of all sorts of Bread, as they and every of them shall think fit, either within the said <hi>City</hi> and the Liberties thereof, or elsewhere, and bring the same to the said <hi>City</hi> and Liberties thereof, where they may expose the same to sale, either in open Market, Shop, or otherwise; Provided the said Bread be wholsome, and well made. And We do hereby strictly charge and command Our May<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors, Sheriffs, and other Officers of the said <hi>City,</hi> all the Officers of Our Army, and all other Our Loving Subjects whatsoever, not to molest or hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der any person or persons whatsoever, who shall come with Bread to the said <hi>City,</hi> nor to press or seize upon their horses, carrs, or truckles, upon any pretence whatsoever: but on the contrary, to be aiding and assisting to them as occasion shall require; and this liberty to continue till Our further Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure be published to the contrary.</p>
